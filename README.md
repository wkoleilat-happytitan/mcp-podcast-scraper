# MCP Podcast Scraper

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that scrapes and transcribes podcast episodes. Designed to work with **Claude Code** or **Claude Desktop** - you provide the podcast, the MCP transcribes it, and Claude summarizes it.

## What It Does

- 🎙️ **Scrapes podcasts** from YouTube videos or RSS feeds
- 🎯 **Transcribes audio** using Deepgram's fast Nova-2 model
- 📁 **Organizes files** by podcast name and episode date
- 🔄 **Tracks podcasts** for new episodes
- ⏭️ **Skips duplicates** - won't re-scrape already processed episodes
- 📋 **Finds incomplete work** - lists episodes that need summarization
- ✏️ **Custom summary prompts** - customize how Claude summarizes for your needs

## How It Works

```
You: "Check for new episodes and summarize them"
         ↓
Claude: Calls check_new_episodes() → Finds new episodes
         ↓
Claude: Calls scrape_podcast() → Downloads & transcribes
         ↓
Claude: Calls get_summary_prompt() → Reads your custom instructions
         ↓
Claude: Calls get_transcript() → Reads the transcript
         ↓
Claude: Summarizes following your prompt
         ↓
Claude: Calls save_summary() → Saves the .md file
         ↓
Done! transcript.md + summary.md saved
```

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Install required system tools (macOS):

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install yt-dlp (for YouTube) and ffmpeg (for audio)
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

### Step 2: Clone & Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wkoleilat-happytitan/mcp-podcast-scraper.git
cd mcp-podcast-scraper

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Get a Deepgram API Key

1. Go to **https://console.deepgram.com/**
2. Sign up (free tier includes **$200 credit** - enough for ~300 hours of audio)
3. Create an API key
4. Copy the key

### Step 4: Configure

Copy the example config file and add your API key:

```bash
# Copy the example config
cp config.example.json config.json

# Edit config.json and add your Deepgram API key
```

Your `config.json` should look like:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "./podcasts",
  "deepgramApiKey": "YOUR_ACTUAL_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY",
  "tempDirectory": "./temp"
}
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit `config.json` to git - it contains your API key! The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

### Step 5: Add to Claude Code

Add this to your Claude Code MCP settings (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or via Settings → MCP):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "podcast-scraper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/mcp-podcast-scraper/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/FULL/PATH/TO/` with the actual path to your installation.

### Step 5 (Alternative): Add to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "podcast-scraper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/mcp-podcast-scraper/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

## Customizing Summary Prompts

Control how Claude summarizes your podcasts by editing `prompts/summary-prompt.md`.

The default prompt is tailored for **Product Managers** and includes:
- 🎯 Episode Overview
- 💡 Key Insights for Product Managers
- 🧠 Mental Models & Frameworks
- 📈 Personal Development Takeaways
- ✅ Action Items
- 💬 Notable Quotes
- 🔗 Related Topics

### Customize for Your Needs

Edit `prompts/summary-prompt.md` to:
- Change the target audience (engineer, designer, founder, etc.)
- Add/remove sections
- Adjust the summary length
- Focus on specific topics
- Change the formatting style

**Example customizations:**

**For Engineers:**
```markdown
Focus on:
- Technical concepts and architecture decisions
- Implementation details worth noting
- Tools and technologies mentioned
- Code patterns and best practices
```

**For Founders:**
```markdown
Focus on:
- Business strategy insights
- Fundraising advice
- Growth tactics
- Leadership lessons
- Mistakes to avoid
```

Claude will read this prompt before generating each summary, ensuring consistent, personalized output.
